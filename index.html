                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="project5Desc" class="project-description" style="display:none;">
                <p>This project involves the architecture and development of a folded cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) using 45nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The key aspects of this project include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Design Objectives:</b> The project aimed to design a folded cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with a voltage biasing circuit. The target specifications included achieving a 71dB gain, a power consumption of 180uW, and a 65Â° phase margin, all within the constraints of a 45nm CMOS design.</li>
                    <li><b>Initial Design and Adjustments:</b> The initial designs involved calculations of slew rate, bias current (Ibias), and transistor ratios. The team initially aimed for transistor scales as small as 10-15 nanometers, but adjustments were made due to the limitations of the Cadence design software, which has a minimum scale of 50nm. Initial designs only achieved a 15dB gain, leading to further adjustments.</li>
                    <li><b>Transistor Sizing and Optimization:</b> The team evaluated and resized transistors in the OTA circuitry, particularly focusing on optimizing overdrive voltage to improve voltage biasing. They experimented with different transistor scales to balance the phase margin and bandwidth performance.</li>
                    <li><b>Voltage Biasing Circuit Design:</b> The voltage biasing circuit was carefully designed to meet the power consumption and gain requirements. Adjustments to the voltage biasing and transistor sizes were made to find an optimal balance that maximized gain.</li>
                    <li><b>Simulation and Results:</b> AC simulations were conducted to test the OTA gain, phase margin, and power consumption. The final design achieved a gain of 71.2005dB, exceeding the target of 70dB, with a 3dB frequency of 11.22kHz, surpassing the 10kHz bandwidth requirement. The phase margin was successfully maintained at 65Â°, and the power consumption was recorded at 62uW, well under the design requirement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, achieved a successful design and optimization of a folded cascode OTA using 45nm technology, with a focus on achieving high gain, low power consumption, and an adequate phase margin. The project involved careful consideration of transistor sizing and voltage biasing, guided by both theoretical calculations and practical adjustments.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="project6Desc" class="project-description" style="display:none;">
                <p>This project involved creating a Python-based fingerprint matching application. The application allows users to upload fingerprint images and compares them against a database to find matches. It utilizes third-party libraries like OpenCV for image processing and tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Image Processing and Matching Algorithm: </b>The application employs OpenCV to preprocess images, including background removal, resizing, and filtering to enhance the accuracy of the matching process. The core of the matching process relies on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, implemented in the runMatcher.py file. This algorithm detects keypoints and descriptors in fingerprint images, and the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) algorithm is used to find matches between these descriptors.</li>
                    <li><b>Matching Process and User Interaction: </b>The application filters matches based on a distance threshold and a minimum match count. If a sufficient number of matches are found, it identifies the fingerprints as matching; otherwise, they are considered non-matching. The application visually represents the matches using green lines between the input image and the database image. If no matches are found, the application prompts the user to save the fingerprint in the database, ensuring that the database can be continually updated with new fingerprints.</li>
                    <li><b>Achievements and Efficiency: </b>The application achieved a high accuracy rate of 95% for fingerprint matching through the implementation of the SIFT algorithm. It also improved matching efficiency by 30% and reduced false positives by 20% through advanced preprocessing techniques and a refined matching process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In summary, this project successfully developed a highly accurate and efficient fingerprint matching application with a user-friendly GUI. It showcases the effective integration of image processing algorithms and GUI design in Python, contributing significantly to the field of digital fingerprint analysis.</p>

                <p>The project, carried out at New York University Tandon School of Engineering, aimed to develop a semi-automated blood pressure and heart rate measuring device. The primary focus was on implementing the Maximum Amplitude Algorithm (MAA) for accurate blood pressure monitoring.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Technical Implementation: </b>The system utilized an STM32f429I discovery board interfaced with a Micro Pressure (MPR) sensor. Communication between the sensor and the board was achieved using the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. The specific SPI pins used for this interface were SPI_MISO (PA_6), SPI_MOSI (PA_7), SPI_SCK (PA_5), and SPI_SS (PB_6).</li>
                    <li><b>Oscillometric Waveform Envelope (OMWE) Graph: </b>The core of the project was to plot the Oscillometric Waveform Envelope graph. This involved recording the peak values of pressure oscillations. The OMWE graph was crucial for determining the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) point, which is a key indicator in blood pressure measurement.</li>
                    <li><b>Systolic and Diastolic Pressure Measurement: </b>The systolic and diastolic pressures were calculated from the MAP using two characteristic ratios, "Rs" (Systolic ratio) and "Rd" (Diastolic ratio). The systolic pressure was determined when the OMWE amplitude equaled RsMAP to the left of the MAP value, while the diastolic pressure corresponded to when the OMWE amplitude equaled RdMAP to the right of the MAP value.</li>
                    <li><b>Accuracy and Effectiveness: </b>The system successfully articulated systolic and diastolic pressures from the MAP with an accuracy of almost 98%. This high accuracy level highlights the effectiveness of the implemented algorithm and the precision of the hardware setup.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In summary, this project represents a significant achievement in the field of embedded systems for medical applications, specifically in the accurate measurement of blood pressure using advanced algorithms and microcontroller interfacing techniques.</p>
